# WP Change Password URL

A tiny (mu) plugin that adds support for the [well-known URL for changing passwords](https://www.w3.org/TR/change-password-url/).

There's a [core ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51173) pending, it could take years. In the meantime, this plugin will bring this feature if you need it.

## Install

```sh
composer require n5s/wp-change-password-url
```
